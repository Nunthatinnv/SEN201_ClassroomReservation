Here is a deeper static analysis of reservationServices.ts:

The file uses TypeScript types for function arguments and return values, improving type safety.
The Slot and CheckConflictArgs types use Date objects, which is appropriate for time-based logic.
The generateWeeklySlots function correctly generates repeated time slots using date arithmetic.
The conflict checking logic efficiently filters and checks for overlapping reservations.
Error handling is present for the Prisma query, logging and rethrowing errors.
The code is modular, with helper functions separated from main logic.
No unused variables or unreachable code detected.
No obvious performance bottlenecks or security issues.
No syntax or type errors found.
